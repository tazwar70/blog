Hello,

My name is Md Shadman Tajwar Haque. I am from a small country in South-East Asia called Bangladesh. I graduated in the year 2018 from American International University - Bangladesh (AIUB) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

Since early 2015, I have been an IEEE member and also have been working as a volunteer for the IEEE AIUB Student Branch. Since then, I have worked in multiple teams with multiple roles, ranging from as a publications volunteer for the IEEE AIUB Student Branch to as a Sub-Editor for the IEEE Bangladesh Section Newsletter to as a Graphics Designer for the IEEE Region 10 Newsletter team.

During my final year in university, I worked on a project and paper titled "Design and Implementation of an IoT based Automated Agricultural Monitoring and Control System" which was then later publsihed at the 2019 International Conference on Robotics, Electrical and Signal Processing Techniques (ICREST). I also received the Honorable Dean's Award for my project. You can find more about my paper here.

After graduation, I did a 4 month internship at Banglalink Digital Communications Limited, a renouned telecommunications company in Bangladesh.
