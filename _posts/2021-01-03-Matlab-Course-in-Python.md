I have re-done my MATLAB course in python to learn and practice Numpy, Matplotlib and Scipy.

Everything was done using Google Colab and was done in 8 parts as follow,

  - [Chapter 1](https://www.tajwar.ml/blog/_posts/MATLAB/MATLAB - Chapter 1.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 2](https://www.tajwar.ml/blog/_posts/MATLAB/MATLAB - Chapter 2.ipynb)
